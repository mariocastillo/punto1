Point 1 
List, Set and Map are interfaces which implements collection interface. The difference between theme are these: 
Duplicity: -List allow to duplicate elements 
-Set doesn’t allow duplicates. 
-Map stored elements as key & value pair. Map doesn’t support duplicate keys but allows duplicate values.

Order: -List maintain the insertion order. 
-Set doesn’t maintain any order; still few classes like linkedhashset maintain the elements insertion order. 
-Map doesn’t maintain order; still few classes like linkedhashmap sorts the elements in the insertion order.
